Unfortunately, other browsers (FireFox, Safari, Edge) will not work as they cannot access the USB port that connects to the Phidget device.\n\n\n## Setting up the Phidget device\n\nWe will be using the Phidget Starter Kit, as shown in this figure:\n<img src=\"./images/KIT4003.jpg\" alt=\"Image of the starter kit\"  width = 500 />\n\nVerify these points:\n- Get a hold of a Phidgets Starter Kit. It should already be assembled. If not, assemble it now.\n    - You will have received instructions with the kit on how to assemble it.\n- The Starter Kit has a humidity sensor attached. If it does not, find the sensor and attach it.\n    - The humidity sensor is a small black box attached with a thin cable. It is marked with the initials \"HUM.\"\n- Connect the Starter Kit to your computer with a USB cable. \n    - The Kit come with a USB cable, it is attached to the Hub device inside the Starter Kit.\n- If you have an older version of the Phidgets, you may need to update its firmware. See the following for details:\n    - https://www.phidgets.com/education/educators/advanced-troubleshooting/firmware-upgrade/\n- As mentioned earlier, make sure you are running this notebook in the Google Chrome browser. \n\n### Notes on local and remote computer\n\nNotice we are using two computers here. There is the laptop (or desktop) computer sitting in front of you, which is the **local** computer. The Callysto Hub, that you're running this notebook on, is actually a piece of software running on a cloud-based network computer located at the Cybera offices in Alberta (usually), and we call this the **remote** computer. \n\nWe want to program in Python on the Callysto Hub, which will be running on the remote computer. The Phidget device is connected to the local computer (the one in front of you) using the USB port. So we need a way to communicate with the device using the local computer. \n\nWe can do this using the Chrome (or Opera) browser and adding some code in the JavaScript language. JavaScript runs on the local computer, in the browser, and so it is able to access the Phidget device. This means we need to include some JavaScript in our notebook, as it has capabilities that Python does not. \n\n### A bit about JavaScript\n\nJavaScript (JS) is just another programming language. It has its own syntax, and there are books and videos that will teach you about JavaScript. We don't want to teach it here, but will introduce some basic features so you can read the code in this Jupyter notebook. \n\nJS looks a lot like Python. Here are some key differences in JS:\n\n- In JS, statements should end with a semicolon, as in: **y = 2+3;**\n- In JS, variables need to be declared, as in: **var x = 0;**\n- In JS, blocks of code are surrounded by braces, **{ }** like this:\n```\nif (do==true) {\n    do_this;\n    and_this;\n} else {\n    do_that;\n}\n```\n- In JS, there is a way to try a piece of code, and if it fails, catch the error. This will be useful as when connecting the Phidget devices. If there is a problem with the hardware or connection, we can handle the error instead of just crashing the program. The syntax looks like this:\n```\ntry {do_this;} catch {handle_error;}\n```\n- finally, there are many options to import code modules in JS. We will use the ESM format:\n```\nimport {someFunction} from \"https://someESMrepo.com/someFile\";\n```\n",

      "source": "## Overview of the code.\n\nIt's a bit tricky to use the Phidget device, as we have to \"tell\" the computer explicity that we want to use the Phidget. This means writing code that tells the computer that first, we want to use the USB port and cable to connect to the device; second, then we want to use a specific device in the starter kit; and finally we want to read data from that device. \n\nWe will do this in a step-by-step manner, so we can understand how the connection process works. At the end, it is always good practice to clean things up by closing all the connections. \n\nThe main steps are thus:\n\n1. Import a Python library called \"anywidget\" that will hold the JS code.\n2. In JS, import the Phidget code from the Phidget company's online repo:\n```\n    import {USBConnection, HumiditySensor} from \"https://esm.sh/phidget22@3.17\";\n```\n3. Open the USB connection and request access from this web page.\n```\n    connection = new USBConnection();\n    connection.connect();\n    connection.requestWebUSBDeviceAccess();\n```\n4. Open the Humidity device.\n```\n    channel = new HumiditySensor();\n    channel.open();\n```\n5. Setup the device to save the Humidity data when the measured value changes.\n```\n    channel.onHumidityChange = function(humidity) {\n       textBox = humidity;\n    };\n\n```\n6. When we are done, close the device and USB connection\n```\n    channel.close();\n    connection.close();\n    connection.delete();\n```\n\nThe details in the code below get complicated because we need to use the try/catch method to watch out for errors. We also use the \"await\" keyword to tell the computer to wait for a bit as it attempts to connect the Phidget. We add some logic to keep track of whether the device is connected or not, and to do the appropriate thing. \n\n## The user interface\n\nFinally, we need a user interface. In the JS code, we will create a button and two text boxes. The button is to connect and disconnect the Phidget. The first text box will report the status of the connection. The second text box reports the data value read from the humidity sensor. \n\nThe JS code connects the user interface to the functions that control the Phidgets. ",
