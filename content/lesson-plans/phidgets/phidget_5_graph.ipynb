It should already be assembled. If not, assemble it now.\n    - You will have received instructions with the kit on how to assemble it.\n- The Starter Kit has a temperature/humidity sensor attached. If it does not, find the sensor and attach it.\n    - The humidity sensor is a small black box attached with a thin cable. It is marked with the initials \"HUM.\"\n- Connect the Starter Kit to your computer with a USB cable. \n    - The Kit come with a USB cable, it is attached to the Hub device inside the Starter Kit.\n- If you have an older version of the Phidgets, you may need to update its firmware. See the following for details:\n    - https://www.phidgets.com/education/educators/advanced-troubleshooting/firmware-upgrade/\n- As mentioned earlier, make sure you are running this notebook in the Google Chrome browser.

For instance, when the temperature crosses an odd integer (e.g. value = 27), the range will jump around from (24,28) t0 (26,30), which is a rather ugly display.\n- Can we update the charts only once a second? That way it is easier to see the slow changes in value.\n- Can we record the x-axis as a time value, so we know at what time certain readings occur?\n- Can we save the data into a file, on some regular basis? This should include data and time stamps, so we have an accurate historical record of the reading.\n",
