These sensors keep track of the temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light levels. Values from the sensors have been recorded several times a day and stored in an online spreadsheet. \n\nYou can see the spreadsheet here: https://ethercalc.net/callysto_plant_01\n\nThe sensors measure data in different units:\n- Temperature, in degrees Celsius. e.g. $20^o C$ is room temperature.\n- Humidity, as a percentage. e.g. 30% to 60% humidity is a typical room. \n- Moisture, as a ratio. e.g. 0.0 is bone dry, 1.0 is soaking wet.\n- Luminance, in lux. e.g. 1,000 lux is the light outdoors on a dark, cloudy day.\n\nIn this notebook we download the data and save it in a Pandas Dataframe. From there we can plot the data, and perform some numerical calculations that give us an idea about the state of the plant's environment.",

Our analysis aimed to identify correlations, such as those between temperature and humidity or the time of day and light levels.\n\nUnusual data points often indicated interesting or unique plant events, like watering occurrences or late-night activities.\n\nTo provide a more quantitative perspective, we calculated trendlines to suggest mathematical relationships between these variables.\n\nAdditionally, we have the capability to access external plant data from the web, enabling us to compare and analyze our own plant-related information with broader datasets.\n\nYou may now go to the next notebook,  which allows you to water your plant via the computer. The notebook is here: \n[plants-phidgets-watering.ipynb](plants-phidgets-watering.ipynb)\n",
