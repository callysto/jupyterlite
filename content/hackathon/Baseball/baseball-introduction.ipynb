    "## Analyzing Pitch Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Baseball is one of the most popular sports in North America, that in the past few decades has seen its popularity rise in countries across the world. As the sport has grown, so has the technology that it uses. Major League Baseball (MLB), the largest professional league in the world, has installed high-tech cameras and other tracking tools in all 30 of its stadiums to allow teams to analyze the game using more advanced methods than ever before. High-performance computers then run complicated programs to turn the video recordings from the cameras into usable data. Teams can use this data to improve their own players' performance, as well as to learn about what their opponents are likely to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "MLB has made this data available for anyone who wants to use it, and we can go through some of it today to see if we can learn more about the game and how data can be used to gain an advantage on our opponents!\n",

    "For today's challenge, we'll be looking at data about the pitches thrown in baseball. Each play starts with a pitch, so there's potentially a lot we can learn from this data. In the 2022 season, over **600,000 pitches were thrown**, which is a lot of data. We don't need quite that much data, so instead we'll focus on just one of the divisions within MLB: the American League East division. This division consists of the Toronto Blue Jays, the New York Yankees, the Boston Red Sox, the Baltimore Orioles, and the Tampa Bay Rays. In the 2022 season, the AL East had the most wins of any division in all of MLB, despite almost half of each team's games being against other teams in the division! To narrow the data even more, we'll just look at data for the month of June 2022.\n",

For this challenge, though all the sites have access to MLB's data, we've downloaded the data from a website called [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/) and stored it in a CSV file so it's easy to access. We can load it here and look at five random observations:"
