    "1. Do you see any relationship between the time remaining and the shot distance?\n",
    "1. Which player attempted, or made, the most shots from far away?\n",
    "1. What was the most common shot distance for each player?\n",
    "1. How often are shots taken from beyond half-court?\n",
    "1. Is there a correlation between `SHOT_TYPE` and `SHOT_DISTANCE`?\n",
    "1. Do different teams show different shot patterns?\n",
    "1. Is there anything else interesting you can find and visualize for these data?\n",
    "1. Remember to complete your reflections at the bottom of this notebook."
