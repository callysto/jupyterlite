    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggested Challenges\n",
    "  \n",
    "1. Explore how columns such as \"FIREPLACE\" and \"BLDG\" can help you to decide which homes to include in Santa's route.\n",
    "1. Plot another graph based on a different category that you think might help. Remember, you can list all the categories or column names using `home_data.columns`.\n",
    "1. Try out different filtering and sorting ideas to see how best to minimize the time that Santa takes to visit homes in Strathcona County.\n",
    "1. Create visualizations of Santa's travel path.\n",
    "1. Define a function to more accurately or more efficiently calculate Santa's travel time.\n",
    "1. Explore the [travelling salesman problem](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).\n",
    "1. Is there anything else interesting you can find and visualize for these data?\n",
    "1. Remember to complete your reflections at the bottom of this notebook."
