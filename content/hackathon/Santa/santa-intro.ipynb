We [think](https://www.sciencealert.com/turns-out-we-have-no-idea-why-the-northern-lights-wreak-havoc-on-our-satellite-technology) the GPS interference is due to strong aurora borealis (Northern Lights) activity which are a result of intense solar storms. Luckily [Strathcona County's Open Data Portal](https://data.strathcona.ca/) includes all of the location data of homes in the county.\n",
