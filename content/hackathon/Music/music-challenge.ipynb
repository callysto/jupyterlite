    "1. Compare the [minimum, maximum, and mean](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pandas-groupby-one-column-and-get-mean-min-and-max-values/) valence (or other feature) by decade.\n",
    "1. Calculate the average energy (or other feature) by artist.\n",
    "1. Are there any features that are common to really long (or really short) songs?\n",
    "1. Explore more datasets from the [data-files repository](https://github.com/callysto/data-files/tree/main/hackathon) (click the `Raw` button).\n",
    "1. See if there are artists with multiple songs in the top 50 or top 100 datasets.\n",
    "1. Use the Spotify API to explore other songs, such as from the [Billions Club Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX7iB3RCnBnN4).\n",
    "1. Is there anything else interesting you can find and visualize for these data?\n",
    "1. Remember to complete your reflections at the bottom of this notebook."
