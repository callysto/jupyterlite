    "# The Birthday Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The [birthday problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem) is a a classic question about the probability of shared birthdays in a group. It is often stated something like \"How large of a group of people would be required in order for the probability of a shared birthday to be greater than 50%?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore the theoretical and experimental probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theoretical Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the theoretical probability of a shared birthday, it's easier to find the probability of every group member having a unique birthday. We'll assume that each of the 366 possible dates is equally likely, which isn't true but is close enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is one person, the probablity of a unique birthday is 100%. A second unique birthday could be any of the remaining 365 days, so the probability of a unique birthday is $\\frac{365}{366}$. For every new person, the probability of a unique birthday decreases and the total probability is the product of all of those. The probability of only unique birthdays in a group of five people would be $\\frac{366}{366} \\times \\frac{365}{366} \\times \\frac{364}{366} \\times \\frac{363}{366} \\times \\frac{362}{366}$. Let run that calculation."
