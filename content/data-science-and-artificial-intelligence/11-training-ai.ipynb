    "1. Upload your cat images to the `cat` class and your dog images to the `dog` class.\n",
    "1. Click the `Train model` button.\n",
    "1. After the training has finished, click the `Export Model` button, click the `Tensorflow Lite` tab on the right, then click the `Download my model` button. The button will change to `Converting model...` and it will take a few minutes, don't click away from that browser tab.\n",
