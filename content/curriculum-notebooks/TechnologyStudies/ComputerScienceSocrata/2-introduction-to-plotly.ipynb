Introduction to Plotly\n", "\n", "by Gustaaf J Wehnes, Calgary Board of Education\n", "\n", "There are two major parts to data science: querying the data, and then interpreting the data. For the latter, few people like to look at tables. A picture is worth a thousand words, so let's *visualize* the data! We will use a brilliant library of graphing tools called [plotly](https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/). Many of the visualizations that you see on the internet will have been built using this library!\n", "\n", "Again, we can just import the library here.

That is because we want to plot the river levels for each day as a continuum. It would be simplest if we translate the *date* of each measurement to the *day of year*. That way, the data sorts itself nicely. The first two lines in the SELECT clause do exactly that through a bit of fancy calculation.
