Joining Datasets\n", "\n", "Unlike standard SQL, SODA does not (currently) support the joining of separate datasets. As you recall, this is a fundamental part of working with data. Often, there are different sets of data for the same entity, and it doesn't make sense to store them all in one dataset. Even if you wanted to, this would quickly increase the # of columns in a dataset.\n", "\n", "For example, the [School Locations](https://data.calgary.ca/Services-and-Amenities/School-Locations/fd9t-tdn2) dataset we have already looked at stores both the geographical information of schools in Calgary. The [School Enrolment](https://data.calgary.ca/Demographics/School-Enrolment-Data/9qye-mibh) dataset stores the enrollment information for schools. It should be quite obvious that these two datasets should remain separate. Most often, you would not need enrollment #s when looking for locations, and vice versa. If the datasets were permanently combined, you likely have a lot of redundant columns. Moreover, the school enrollment dataset is *keyed* on the school year. You would have to repeat the geographical data in each row, which would be a poor use of space.\n", "\n", "But, what if we wanted to demonstrate additional features of the scattermapbox by visualizing school enrollment? We will need to obtain data from the two seperate datasets, and dynamically *join* them together. As mentioned, we can't do it in SODA, but we can do so programatically using the pandas 'merge' function."]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["import requests as rq\n", "import pandas as pd\n", "import io as io\n", "\n", "domain = \"https://data.calgary.ca/resource/\"\n", "\n", "uuid_school_locations = \"fd9t-tdn2\"\n", "uuid_school_enrollment = \"9qye-mibh\"\n", "\n", "def run_query(domain, uuid, query):\n", "    session = rq.Session()\n", "    results = session.get(domain + uuid +\".csv?$query=\" + query)\n", "    dataframe =  pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(results.content.decode('utf-8')))\n", "    return dataframe"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["The first dataset contains latitude and longitude "]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["query = \"\"\"\n", "SELECT\n", "    *\n", "\"\"\"\n", "\n", "calgary_school_location = run_query(domain, uuid_school_locations, query)\n", "calgary_school_location"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["The second dataset contains enrollment data.
