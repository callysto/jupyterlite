    "Our lives are full of random events! To be an informed and successful person, it is important to get a \"feel\" for randomness. What is a random event? Flipping a coin, rolling dice, shuffling cards, and lottery draws are all examples of random events. There are **two basic types** of random events: **dependent** random events, and **independent** random events.\n",
    "    \n",
    "What are **dependent** random events? Sometimes the occurrence of an event can affect the probability of the next event occurring. For example, consider removing a playing card from a deck of cards. As you take each card, there are fewer cards left in the deck, and so the probability of drawing a particular card changes on later draws.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will focus on **independent** events. As you've probably guessed, these are events that are **not affected** by previous events.\n",
