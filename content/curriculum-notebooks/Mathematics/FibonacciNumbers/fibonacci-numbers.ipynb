    "- a **sequence** is an ordered list of numbers, which may go on forever.\n",

    "- each number in this sequence is the sum of the two coming before it in the sequence.\n",
    "- the sequence grows fast, increasing by a **factor** of about **10** for every **five** terms.\n",
    "- the **ratio** of pairs of Fibonacci numbers converges to the **Golden ratio,** known since the ancient Greeks as the number\n",
    "$$\\varphi = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\approx 1.6108.$$\n",
    "- the Fibonacci numbers can be computed directly as the difference of powers of $\\varphi$ and its **conjugate,** $\\psi = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}.$ This is sometimes faster than computing the whole list of Fibonnaci numbers.\n",
    "- this formula with powers of $\\varphi, \\psi$ is verified using **induction.**\n",
    "- The Fibonacci numbers can be **extended** to a **continuous function** $Fib(x)$, defined for all real numbers $x$ (including negatives). It **oscillates** (wiggles) on the negative x-axis.\n",
    "- The **Golden Ratio** can also be expressed a **continued fraction,** which is an infinite expansion of fractions with sub-fraction terms. Many interesting numbers come from interesting continued fraction forms."
