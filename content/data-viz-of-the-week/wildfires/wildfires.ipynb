    "# Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently in Canada, wildfires have become a *hot* topic. They are a significant natural disaster that poses a threatening risk to ecosystems, human lives, and the environment. Canada, known for its vast forests and diverse ecosystems, has experienced its fair share of devastating wildfires in recent years. These fires not only have a profound impact on Canada but also affect nearby countries and have broader implications for the climate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Wildfires in Canada have a significant impact on the environment, particularly in heavily forested regions with a lack of rain. The primary damage done by fires is the loss of trees, which are being essential carbon sinks that help in absorbing greenhouse gases and mitigating climate change. The loss of these forests due to wildfires can release a substantial amount of carbon dioxide back in the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. \n",
    "\n",
    "The consequences of Canadian wildfires beyond its borders, impacting nearby countries such as the United States has also reached global news. Due to the raging wildfires in northwest Quebec, New York City recorded some its worst air quality to date, being equivalent to smoking 25-30 cigarettes. This smoke continues to travel in the United States, damaging nearby cities with poor air quality."

    "| Human Activity | Wildfires caused by human activity refer to fires ignited as a result of human actions. These can include accidental causes like discarded cigarettes, unattended campfires, sparks from equipment or machinery, power line failures, or intentional acts of arson. Human-caused wildfires can occur in both urban and rural areas and can have various impacts depending on the location, climate, and fuel availability. |\n",
    "| Lightning | Lightning-caused wildfires originate from natural electrical discharges during dry thunderstorms. Lightning strikes can ignite fires when they come into contact with dry vegetation, especially in regions with dry and windy conditions. These wildfires are a natural occurrence and can be prevalent in remote or forested areas where lightning strikes are more likely to occur. |\n",
    "| Prescribed Burn | A prescribed burn, also known as a controlled burn or prescribed fire, is a planned fire intentionally set by fire management authorities. These burns are carefully controlled and conducted under specific conditions to reduce the risk of uncontrolled wildfires. Prescribed burns are often used for ecological purposes, such as promoting forest health, reducing fuel loads, managing vegetation, or restoring natural fire regimes. |\n",
    "| Reburn | Reburn refers to a situation where a previously burned area reignites due to residual heat or smoldering embers from a previous wildfire. Even after a fire has been extinguished, heat can remain trapped within logs, root systems, or organic material. Under certain conditions, such as dry and windy weather, these residual heat sources can reignite, leading to a new fire within the previously burned area. Reburns can be challenging to detect and control, as they can occur unexpectedly and often in areas where firefighting resources have been recently deployed.  |\n",

    "In terms of general trends found in the visualizations, starting with the figure *Area Burned from Wildfires by Cause*, `Lightning` appears to be the main factor in terms of area burned by wildfires. In comparison with the *Number of Figures by Cause* figure, `Human Activity` and `Lightning` are clear front-runners in terms of number of fires started. Something that also stands out is despite the frequency of fires started by `Human Activity`, there seems to be a drastic fall-off in terms of area burned. Furthermore, due to the sheer scale of `Human Activity` and `Lightning`, columns like `Prescribed burn` and `Reburn` become hard to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some particular reasons why lightning may generate more hectares burned compared to human activity could be:\n",
    "1. Location: The locations of where wildfires begin can influence their behavior and the extent of the burned area. Human-caused fires often occur in more populated areas, where vegetation may be managed or more fragmented, leading to smaller, localized fires. In contrast, lightning-caused fires can occur in remote and inaccessible areas with abundant and continuous fuel, allowing the fire to spread over larger areas.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Natural Factors: Lightning-caused fires are often associated with thunderstorms, which can occur in regions with favorable atmospheric conditions for fire spread, such as dry and windy conditions. Lightning strikes during these conditions can ignite wildfires that are more likely to spread rapidly and cover extensive areas.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Human Intervention: Like mentioned earlier, many human activity related fires begin in populated areas. As a result, oftentimes there is prompt response and intervention in order to mitigate the spread of the fire. Well-established firefighting infrastructure and strategies, such as firebreaks, water sources, and aerial resources, also significantly mitigate the impact of human-caused fires."

    "\n",
    "Provinces such as *Alberta*, *British Columbia*, and *Ontario* stand out as having a high number of fires started compared to other provinces such as *Prince Edward Island*. One of the main reasons for this is due to population density. Alberta, B.C, and Ontario are among the most populous provinces in Canada, with larger urban centers and a higher concentration of human activity. Increased human presence, along with more infrastructure, such as roads, power lines, and recreational areas, can lead to a higher likelihood of human-caused fires.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting observation seen in the `Lightning` cause is that despite *Northwest Territories* and *Saskatchewan* having an average number of fires started, they have the 1st and 2nd highest number of land burnt respectively. A particular reason for this could be due to the land characteristics of these provinces. Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories have extensive areas of grasslands, boreal forests, and tundra, which are highly flammable during dry periods. These regions have a significant amount of fuel available to burn, leading to larger fire sizes when ignited. In contrast, B.C and Alberta have a more diverse landscape, including mountainous terrain and a mix of forest types, which can sometimes act as natural barriers and limit the spread of wildfires. Another significant factor is the climate and weather patterns in Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Often, these provinces have drier and hotter climates compared to other provinces. The combination of low rainfall, high temperatures, and prolonged periods of drought increases the potential for fires to ignite and spread more rapidly. "

    "Looking at the figures above, one quite obvious trend seen is that as the size of fires increase, the more damaging they become in terms of area burnt due to the wildfire. The largest point seen in *figure 3*, was found in the Northwest Territories with a value of 2,447,000 million hectares of land burnt. That's approximately equivalent 5 million football fields, which is an absurd number to visualize. On the opposite side, surprisingly certain wildfires were recorded having no land burnt despite being considered a \"wildfire\". A particular reason why this could have happened is due to an immediate response to a fire starting, and thus forced being recorded into the certain fire databases despite a lack of land burnt. "

    "Starting with general trends found in many provinces, it appears that most wildfires start during the months of **April-September**, peaking in July or August. This makes sense as during the spring and summer months, many provinces experience higher temperatures, lower humidity levels, and reduced precipitation. These weather conditions create a drier environment, which increases the risk of wildfires. Dry vegetation, such as grasses, shrubs, and trees, becomes more flammable and susceptible to ignition from various sources. During fall and winter, cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels help maintain higher moisture content in vegetation, making it less prone to ignition and slower to burn. Furthermore, as noted before, *lightning* is the primary causes of wildfires in Canada. As such, in certain provinces, thunderstorms are more prevalent during the summer months, leading to an increased number of lightning strikes that can ignite fires.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain provinces that are similar in composition such as *Alberta,* and *Saskatchewan,* and *Northwest Territories* shared similarities in trends of wildfires, which makes sense. Provinces that are closer to each other are expected to share similarities in terms of environmental composition, and thus, would be likely to share wildfire patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of minor differences in provinces found in this visualization, certain maritime provinces such as *P.E.I* and *New Brunswick* will show different behaviour. Try modifying the code above to create plots for these other provinces. You may find that the maritime provinces appear to have an extremely low level of wildfires started. This can be attributed to the maritime provinces having a cooler and more humid climate compared to other regions in Canada. The proximity to the Atlantic Ocean also influences the weather patterns, resulting in milder summers with higher precipitation levels."
