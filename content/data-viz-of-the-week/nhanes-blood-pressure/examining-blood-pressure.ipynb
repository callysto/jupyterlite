    "Callysto's Weekly Data Visualization is a learning resource that aims to develop data literacy skills.

This companion resource walks learners through how the data visualization is created and interpreted by a data scientist. \n",

    "# Question\n",
    "\n",
    "How do the health measurements in the supplied dataset compare to those in the classroom? This notebook is interactive in that a classroom element can be added by allowing students to collect their own measurements and compare.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "Our goal is to investigate an accessible type of data (body measurements) and compare it against at least one other set of the same measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "- How are the datasets similar? \n",
    "- How are they different? \n",
    "- What could be a cause of the differences?\n",
    "- Is there anything in the data that's surprising or sticks out?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that we're looking at in particular is taken from several thousand American children and adults. For each person we have height mesurements, systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements, as well as [resting heart rate](https://www.heartandstroke.ca/heart-disease/what-is-heart-disease/how-a-healthy-heart-works). All measurements were recorded three times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blood Pressure\n",
    "\n",
    "Blood pressure is an [important indicator of cardiovascular health](https://www.heartandstroke.ca/heart-disease/risk-and-prevention/condition-risk-factors/high-blood-pressure). The measurement typically consists of two numbers: systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure. Blood pressure is usually recorded as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{120}{80} mmHg\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the units are **millimetres of mercury (mmHg)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first number, systolic, is the pressure exerted by the heart on the arteries as it contracts and forces blood out of the left ventricle. This number can change quickly and frequently, often as a response to both negative stressors on the body (emotion, illness) or as a natural response to healthy states (exercise, sleep). The **typical healthy systolic blood pressure in adults is ~120 mmHg**, though it's not uncommon to have lower blood pressures in active adults and children. Higher (resting) values of systolic blood pressure are generally a negative sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diastolic blood pressure is the second value reported and is more stable than systolic blood pressure. It represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart is between beats. A **typical healthy diastolic blood pressure is ~80 mmHg**, though similar to systolic, it's not unusual to have lower values. As this measurement is more stable, seeing higher values of diastolic blood pressure is more concerning than higher values of systolic.\n",
    "\n",
    "When *either* resting blood pressure value is above a certain number (>135 for systolic, >85 for diastolic), it indicates the presence of a condition called **hypertension**. Hypertension, or just simply high blood pressure, [can put you at risk of several nasty health problems](https://www.heartandstroke.ca/-/media/pdf-files/canada/health-information-catalogue/en-managing-your-blood-pressure.ashx) such as heart attack and stroke. The routine measurement of blood pressure is important to detect hypertension. It's also critical to not make a diagnosis on a single measurement as that value can be abnormally high (or low) on that particular day and may not truly be of concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heart Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably one of the simplest measurements of body function to collect is heart rate. There are [multiple locations on the body that can be used to measure heart rate](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-check-heart-rate), but the easiest is the radial artery in the wrist:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Radial HR measurement](img/VHFC0134_How_do_I_measure_my_heart_rate_image1.jpeg)\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<font size=\"1\"> \n",
    "    https://s32917.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/VHFC0134_How_do_I_measure_my_heart_rate_image1.jpeg\n",
    "</font>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By counting the number of beats that occur in a 15-second time period, and multiplying that number by 4, you can measure your heart rate in **beats per minute (bpm)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical (resting) heart rate in adults is between 60-72 bpm (up to 100 bpm in children), though extremely fit individuals can have a much lower heart rate. Heart rate can be elevated by the same stressors as blood pressure (exercise, emotional state) and can drop considerably during sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though blood pressure requires equipment to properly measure, both heart rate and height can be measured in the classroom. As you learn about visualizing this data, think about collecting your own and see how it compares."
