    "Callysto's Weekly Data Visualization is a learning resource that aims to develop data literacy skills.

This companion resource walks learners through how the data visualization is created and interpreted by a data scientist. \n",

    "4. Explore - Examine the data to look for evidence to answer the question. This includes creating visualizations. \n",

    "We will use longitude and latitude points of these stations and plot them on a geographical map using plotly (a popular python library used for creating plots). We can also see the distance someone would have to travel from a specific address to reach one of these charging stations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will also use a bar chart to compare the distance needed to travel for each fuel type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fuel types we will explore are:\n",
    "- Biodiesel\n",
    "- CNG\n",
    "- Electric\n",
    "- Ethanol\n",
    "- Hydrogen\n",
    "- LNG\n",
