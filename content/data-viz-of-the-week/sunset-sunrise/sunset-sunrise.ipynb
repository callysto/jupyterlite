    "[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a library that helps us with data analysis, and [plotly express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) is a library that helps us to make visualizations. [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) help read the sunset and sunrise data from an external API. If you are not familiar with what an API is or does, it essentially sends information to one party from another. For example, many Twitter bots make use of the Twitter API where twitter sends information these bots may need in order to properly function. [Datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) supplies information in regards to manipulating dates and times and [tzfpy](https://pypi.org/project/tzfpy/) allows us to find timezone names by supplying longitude and latitude values. \n",

Timezones help us keep track of these different times and make sure everyone knows when the sun will rise and set in their area.
