    "\n",
    "Callysto's Weekly Data Visualization is a learning resource that aims to develop data literacy skills. We provide grades 5-12 teachers and students with a data visualization, like a graph, to interpret. This companion resource walks learners through how the data visualization is created and interpreted by a data scientist. \n",

    "4. Explore - Examine the data to look for evidence to answer our question. This includes creating visualizations. \n",

It is found throughout the atmosphere and has dramatically increased in atmospheric concentration since industrialization. Have you ever wondered how Canada's CO2 emissions compare to other countries?\n",

    "### Goal\n",
    "We want to see how Canada's per capita CO2 emissions compare with those of our partner [G7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Seven) nations. To do this we will create a figure with a line of per capita CO2 emissions using [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/) data. We will also create other plots that may be of interest."
