    "\n",
    "Callysto's Weekly Data Visualization is a learning resource that aims to develop data literacy skills. We provide grades 5-12 teachers and students with a data visualization, like a graph, to interpret. This companion resource walks learners through how the data visualization is created and interpreted by a data scientist. \n",

It is found throughout the atmosphere and has dramatically increased in atmospheric concentration since industrialization. Have you ever wondered how Canada's CO2 emissions compare to other countries?\n",

    "### Goal\n",
    "We want to see how Canada's per capita CO2 emissions compare with those of our partner [G7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Seven) nations. To do this we will create a figure with a line of per capita CO2 emissions using [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/) data. We will also create other plots that may be of interest."
