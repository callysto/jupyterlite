    "Callysto's Weekly Data Visualization is a learning resource that aims to develop data literacy skills. We provide Grades 5-12 teachers and students with a data visualization, like a graph, to interpret. This companion resource walks learners through how the data visualization is created and interpreted by a data scientist. \n",

    "2. Gather - Find the data source(s) you will need. \n",
    "3. Organize - Arrange the data, so that you can easily explore it. \n",
    "4. Explore - Examine the data to look for evidence to answer the question. This includes creating visualizations. \n",
    "5. Interpret - Describe what's happening in the data visualization. \n",

    "As of May 2022, prices in Canadian grocery stores are soaring, and the trend only looks set to continue. The surge in prices is attributed to a number of factors including the myriad effects of COVID-19, serious supply chain constraints, ongoing climate change, among others.
