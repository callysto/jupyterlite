    "Callysto's Weekly Data Visualization is a learning resource that aims to develop data literacy skills. We provide Grades 5-12 teachers and students with a data visualization, like a graph, to interpret. This companion resource walks learners through how the data visualization is created and interpreted by a data scientist. \n",

    "1. Question - What are we trying to answer? \n",
    "2. Gather - Find the data source(s) you will need. \n",
    "3. Organize - Arrange the data, so that you can easily explore it. \n",
    "4. Explore - Examine the data to look for evidence to answer the question. This includes creating visualizations. \n",
    "5. Interpret - Describe what's happening in the data visualization. \n",
    "6. Communicate - Explain how the evidence answers the question. "

    "As of May 2022, prices in Canadian grocery stores are soaring, and the trend only looks set to continue. The surge in prices is attributed to a number of factors including the myriad effects of COVID-19, serious supply chain constraints, ongoing climate change, among others.
