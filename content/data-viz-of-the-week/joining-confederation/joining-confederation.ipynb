    "# Question\n",
    "July 1st, 1867 marks an important date in Canadian history - Canadian Confederation. Three British North American provinces joined to form the Dominion of Canada. After Confederation, Canada was divided into four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. Over 150 years later, Canada is now composed of ten provinces and three territories. The current composition of Canada was finalized on April 1st, 1999 with the birth of Nunavut. However, *what happened* between July 1st, 1867 and April 1st, 1999? We will create a timeline of events between Canadian Confederation and today."
