    "The value that we're comparing these computers across is **floating point operations per second** (FLOPS), a common measure when looking at computing power. FLOPS refer to the ability of a computer to do math with floating-point (or decimal) numbers; a task difficult for humans to do, but trivial and common for computers. For reference, below are a few examples of how the average human stacks up, so we may compare with computers.\n",

Though the GFLOPS threshold was only crossed for the first time in the 1980s, comparing the computing power to the cost allows us to evaluate older computers alongside modern devices, as below."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "There's been significant improvements in computing power in the last several decades. The first general purpose digital computer, [ENIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC), had a cost per GFLOPS of over *$1.8 quadrillion*. That's a number approximately 20x higher than the estimated total amount of money in the world [source](https://www.gobankingrates.com/money/economy/how-much-money-is-in-the-world/). Compare that to the devices commercially available today, such as NVIDIA's RTX 4090 that can be purchased at most electronics stores (in early 2023), where the cost per GFLOPS is in the *cents* range.\n",
