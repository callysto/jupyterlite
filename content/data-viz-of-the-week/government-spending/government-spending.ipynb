    "It appears that half of the categories have *decreased* in overall percentage while the other half of categories *increased* in percentage throughout the years of 2008 to 2021. An interesting thing to note is the largest positive increase was in the year 2019-2020 with a 7% increase in social protection. A potential reasoning to why social protection increased so much in this year was that this was that this was the beginning of Covid-19. Unemployment soared during this time and the government may have had to assist more due to increasing poverty rates. However, many would assume *health* would have been prioritized if this was the case, but surprisingly it's allocation in budget decreased. \n",
