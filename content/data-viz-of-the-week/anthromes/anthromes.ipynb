The top left plot(where data points are seperated by 1000 year intervals), 10000 BCE to 0, is incredibly stable with very little land devoted to settlements or agriculture. Between 0 and 1700 we see more change than in the previous 10000 years. The plot with the most dynamic elements is the one between 1700 and 2000. Here, we see incredible shifting away from seminatural lands to agricultural lands and the emergence of more villages around the turn of the last century. Finally, between 2000 and 2017 we note little change.\n",
