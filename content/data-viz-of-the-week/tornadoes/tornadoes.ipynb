This companion resource walks learners through how the data visualization is created and interpreted by a data scientist.\n",

    "\n",
    "Tornados are an extreme weather event that occurs in Canada. The [Northern Tornados Project](https://uwo.ca/ntp/about.html) is a project founded at Western Unviersity in 2017. The project aims to better understand the occurrence of tornados in Canada to provide more understanding on tornados and to increase the ability to predict tornados so that the damage to property and danger to humans can be reduced. The Northern Tornados Project has published data they have on the occurrence of Tornados in Canada.\n",
