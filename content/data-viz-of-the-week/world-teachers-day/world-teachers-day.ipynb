    "\n",
    "Callysto's Weekly Data Visualization is a learning resource that aims to develop data literacy skills. We provide Grades 5-12 teachers and students with a data visualization, like a graph, to interpret. This companion resource walks learners through how the data visualization is created and interpreted by a data scientist. \n",

    "The steps of the data analysis process are listed below and applied to each weekly topic.\n",

    "1. Question - What are we trying to answer? \n",
    "2. Gather - Find the data source(s) you will need. \n",
    "3. Organize - Arrange the data, so that you can easily explore it. \n",
    "4. Explore - Examine the data to look for evidence to answer the question. This includes creating visualizations. \n",
    "5. Interpret - Describe what's happening in the data visualization. \n",
    "6. Communicate - Explain how the evidence answers the question. "

    "**World Teachers' Day** is a day of celebration for all teachers around the globe, returning annaully on **October 5th**. It celebrates the positive impacts teachers have made in transforming education and reflects on the support they provided to their students. More than 100 countries celebrate World Teachers' Day with slight differences on the date. For example, India celerbates World Teachers' Day on September 5th, a month earlier than Canada. \n",
