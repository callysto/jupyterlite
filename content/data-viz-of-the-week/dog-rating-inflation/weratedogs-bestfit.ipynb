    "### About This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Callysto's Weekly Data Visualization is a learning resource that helps Grades 5-12 teachers and students grow and develop data literacy skills. We do this by providing a data visualization, like a graph, and asking teachers and students to interpret it. This companion resource walks learners through how the data visualization is created and interpreted using the data science process. The steps of this process are listed below and applied to each weekly topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Question - What are we trying to answer?\n",
    "2. Gather - Find the data source(s) you will need.\n",
    "3. Organize - Arrange the data so that you can easily explore it.\n",
    "4. Explore - Examine the data to look for evidence to answer our question. This includes creating visualizations.\n",
    "5. Interpret - Explain how the evidence answers our question.\n",
    "6. Communicate - Reflect on the interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Acknowledgment\n",
    "The dataset we used in this week’s visualization is from [Greg Baker](https://www.sfu.ca/computing/people/faculty/gregbaker.html), a Computing Science instructor at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. This visualization is inspired by [this](http://dhmontgomery.com/2017/03/dogrates/) data science exploration."

    "[WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) is a [popular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs) twitter account that offers humorous dog ratings and has spawned many memes. The Twitter exchange above was a popular meme a few years ago, and the account is even [credited](https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/04/23/524514526/dogs-are-doggos-an-internet-language-built-around-love-for-the-puppers) with creating or formalizing the \"pupper\" and \"doggo\" lingo used to describe dogs over the internet. Much like 4chan users are credited with creating a \"LOLCAT\" pigeon language in the early 2000s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of exploring the history of internet memes, the account can demonstrate the concept of grade inflation. Usually when grade inflation is discussed, it is in the context of high schools or universities giving out more B and A grades leading to a diminishing value or meaning of those grades. Here we will see how scores given out by the WeRateDogs account may or may not be suffering from grade inflation. Hence, our question for this notebook is:\n",
