Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Winter Storm	Southern Ontario	12/21/2013 12:00:00 AM	Southern Ontario, ON, December 21, 2013 to January 1, 2014. A severe storm brought freezing rain and damaging ice accumulation across a large area of southern Ontario. According to Environment Canada, the epicentre of the freezing rain was in southern Ontario along the north shore of Lake Ontario, including the Greater Toronto Area, where ice accumulation reached up to 30 mm. The impact of the ice storm on these municipalities and conservation authorities was further exacerbated by freezing temperatures. The ice storm had serious impacts. In its aftermath, as many as 830,000 hydro customers (2,490,000 individuals) across Southern Ontario were without power for several days. Downed trees, broken branches, and downed wires resulting from ice accumulation posed serious public health and safety risks, as well as transportation network problems. Due to widespread power outages and freezing temperatures, municipalities activated emergency plans to open warming centres and canvassed homes of vulnerable residents to ensure their safety. Power was restored to most residences and businesses by January 1, 2014.
Response and recovery activities began at the time of the event. The ice storm significantly impacted some of Canada?s largest and most densely populated urban municipalities. Municipalities, provincial ministries and non-governmental organizations such as the Red Cross all acted to respond to the ice storm. Ontario determined that the impacts of the storm were severe enough to warrant implementation of an Ice Storm Assistance Program to help municipalities and conservation authorities with emergency response and recovery costs. Two deaths were attributed to the storm due to carbon monoxide poisoning from improperly ventilated generators and heaters.

Bill's steady downpour and fierce winds knocked out power to 40,000 residents. More than a dozen flights from Halifax International Airport were cancelled and ferry services were suspended between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. In Newfoundland and Labrador there were road washouts and some localized flooding.	0	0	0	0.0000	0.0	8/23/2009 12:00:00 AM								40000	0.0	
Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Tornado	Toronto, Windsor, Vaughan and Newmarket ON	8/20/2009 12:00:00 AM	Toronto, Windsor, Vaughan and Newmarket ON, August 20, 2009.  A super cell storm developed just south of Lake Huron and tracked northeastward for a remarkable 200 kilometres. The heat and humidity in Ontario increased once the clouds disappeared. A squall line developed over Lower Michigan and traveled across the Great Lakes reaching southern Ontario at 15:00 EDT. This system produced powerful winds from Windsor to northeast of Toronto as well as destructive tornadoes in Vaughan and Newmarket. While these tornadoes were wreaking havoc just north of Toronto, another series of super cell thunderstorms spawned tornadoes in parts of Simcoe County, Muskoka and Parry Sound Districts to the east of Georgian Bay and north towards Lake Nipissing. In total, the day?s weather produced 19 confirmed tornadoes, including: four F0, eleven F1, and four F2. This was the greatest number of F2 tornadoes in Ontario in one day since the Barrie/central Ontario tornadoes of May 31, 1985. It was also a new Canadian record for the most confirmed tornadoes in one day. Violent winds snapped trees, lifted roofs, flattened cars, mowed down fences, collapsed farm buildings, and inflicted property losses around $100 million. The first tornado of the day touched down in the town of Durham in Grey County, killing a young boy as he left a nearby conservation area day camp. About 600 homes, mostly in the communities of Maple and Woodbridge were damaged. Fourty were destroyed and declared unsafe. At the peak of the storm, Hydro One reported that 69,000 customers (approximately 207,000 individuals) had lost power.	1	0	0	96183000.0000	5044562.9	8/20/2009 12:00:00 AM						96183000.0000		207000	0.0

A powerful F2 tornado touched down in D?l?age at 14:00 EST and track 40 kilometres through Aumond, to Mont-Laurier in the upper Laurentians. The tornado blew away roofs, knocked down walls, flipped over cars, snapped utility poles and downed power lines leaving 4000 residents (12,000 individuals) without power. In Mont-Laurier, 40 homes were damaged, amoung those 28 were rendered uninhabitable. There were no fatalities, although two people were injured and taken to the hospital. The tornado caused about $6 million in insured losses. The tornado's path through Mont-Laurier was 300 metres wide, but its 40 kilometre track was an unusually long distance for a tornado in Quebec and a strong indication of the storm's severity. Previous to this event, the last time a stronger tornado touched down in the Quebec was on the same day in 1994 when an F3 tornado destroyed more than 400 homes in Aylmer.	0	0	0	6000000.0000	314685.3	8/4/2009 12:00:00 AM						6000000.0000		12000	0.0

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Storms and Severe Thunderstorms	Hamilton and Toronto ON	7/26/2009 12:00:00 AM	Hamilton and Toronto ON, July 26, 2009. A storm cell stalled over the western end of Lake Ontario. Hamilton was hard hit. Waves of thunderstorms pounded the city, leaving citizens with flooded basements and motorists stuck in traffic caused by road closures. The midday downpour turned Red Hill Creek into an angry brown torrent that forced the closure of nearby roads and highways. Water gushed into 7000 basements and power was shut off to thousands of customers. While the Hamilton Airport observed only 28 mm of rain, radar estimates confirmed rainfall amounts in an unofficial gauge totaling 110 mm in two hours - worse than a 100-year storm and one of the most intense short-duration rainfalls on record in Canada. Conditions were made worse because the ground was super-saturated from storms two days earlier. In Toronto, parts of Lakeshore Boulevard near the Exhibition grounds were submerged. To the north, a pair of giant sinkholes swallowed part of Finch Avenue West - big enough to hold a fleet of cars and deep enough to cover a four-storey building.	0	0	0	173312000.0000	9089790.2	7/26/2009 12:00:00 AM						173312000.0000		0	0.0

A freshet in spring 2009 caused flooding in a number of communities, primarily from the formation of ice jams which raised water levels along the Saint John, Miramichi, and Restigouche rivers from April 5 to May 4.  The flooding caused damages to homes, businesses and infrastructure such as roadways.  Preliminary eligible costs are estimated at $2.0 million, which would result in a federal share of approximately $626,000.	0	0	0	2000000.0000	104895.1	5/4/2009 12:00:00 AM	626000.0000	1374000.0000						0	0.0	
Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Flood	Roseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk MB	3/24/2009 12:00:00 AM	Roseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk MB, March 24 to May 21, 2009. Overland flooding caused by a combination of snowmelt, seasonal precipitation and the spring breakup affected southern Manitoba's watershed areas of the Red, Pembina, Assiniboine, and Souris Rivers. The event caused flooding of houses and evacuations from communities including Roseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk. The flooding also resulted in damage to public infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and highways. Three principal factors led to the spring flooding: 1) Heavy autumn rains, about 43 per cent more than normal, saturated the ground just before freezing in early December, which left little room for absorbing snow melt in the spring; 2) It was a snowy winter in southern Manitoba with some 25 per cent more snowfall than normal. Heavy snowfalls and copious spring rains swelled the critical headwaters of North Dakota sending excessive waters north into Canada via the Red River and its tributaries; and, 3) An unseasonably cold spring slowed basin snow melting, ice decaying in rivers, and overland flow from ditches and culverts.	0	0	3000	76506000.0000	4012552.4	5/21/2009 12:00:00 AM	70006000.0000	6500000.0000						0	0.0	
Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Drought	Saskatchewan and Alberta	3/1/2009 12:00:00 AM	Saskatchewan and Alberta, March 1 to July 1, 2009.  The Canadian Wheat Board projected lower crop prospects by 20 per cent across the Prairies. A dozen counties and municipal districts in Alberta declared a state of drought emergency or disaster. For example, Saskatoon had less than one-quarter of the usual amount of spring precipitation, making the months of March, April and May the driest since record-keeping began in 1892. It wasn't just spring that was dry. The soil moisture recharge period between September 1, 2008 and March 31, 2009 had less than 60 per cent of normal precipitation. To the west, in Alberta, conditions were even drier, as illustrated by precipitation amounts in Edmonton, where the 12- month total rain and snow from July 2008 to June 2009 was only 234 mm, less than half of normal and the driest such period with records dating back to 1880. Making matters worse, eight of the last ten years in Alberta's capital of Edmonton had less rain and snow than the 30-year average total, but no year was as scanty as the most recent. Not surprisingly, the flow of the North Saskatchewan River was at its third lowest level in nearly a century.	0	0	0	0.0000	0.0	7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM								0	0.0

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Winter Storm	Labrador City NL	1/19/1982 12:00:00 AM	Labrador City NL, January 19, 1982. Leading up to the January 18th event, temperatures were in the -12 to -35 degrees Celsius range.  On the 18th, temperatures decreased further to the -30 to -40 degrees Celsius range.  Winds from the west were 65 km/hr with wind gusts up to 111 km/hr occurring during the evening hours.  This resulted in wind chills of -53 to -58 degrees Celsius.  Heavy snowfall and high winds reduced visibility to near zero, and were the cause of a power outage at the Harrie Lake Trailer Court.  The outage left residents without heat or hydro, and the extreme cold caused water pipes to freeze and burst within a majority of the residences.  The Mayor declared a local state of emergency, loaders and dump trucks were brought in to create access routes, and 2,000 residents of the trailer park were evacuated to A.P. Lowe School.	0	0	2000			1/19/1982 12:00:00 AM	0.0000	0.0000						0	0.0

A severe storm hit St. John's with winds of up to 220 km/h and left 55 cm of snow on the ground.  An avalanche struck two houses and swept them down the slope, hitting two other houses.  Over 50 rescue workers and residents worked for 12 hours, digging through the snow and the debris to free trapped residents.  In the Outer Battery, another avalanche (caused by the same storm) buried a house that withheld the weight of the snow.  The strong structure protected the residents; however, they were trapped until dug out by rescue workers.  This was the second avalanche to affect The Battery in 40 years.  Inspection of the slopes has shown that a rockfall risk exists, and that The Battery is frequently affected by rockfalls.  The City of St. John's has recently constructed safety fences to protect against rockfalls and avalanches in the Outer Battery area.	5	9	0			2/16/1959 12:00:00 AM								0	0.0

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Wildfire	Chinchaga River, Alberta	6/2/1950 12:00:00 AM	On June 2nd, a wildfire (the Whisp fire) was reported north of Fort John near Whispering Pines Lake, BC. After an inspection, it was decided to let the 80 ha fire burn freely. According to the policy at the time, fire crews were not allowed to suppress fires until they were within a certain distance of a road, community or major river. Even though local Metis trappers volunteered to help suppress the fire as it moved towards and into Alberta, fire crews were ordered not to go. A second fire began on July 29th, and eventually joined the Whisp fire between September 20 and 22nd. By this time, there were over 30 fires greater than 200 ha burning along the northern borders of BC and Alberta; the newly-merged Chinchaga fire spread 63 km. The smoke plume drifted from northern Alberta to southern Ontario which caused high mid-day electricity demand to turn on the lights and subsequently led to several power outages. The Whisp/Chinchaga fires burned 1.4 million ha (14,000 km2) and was recorded as the largest wildfire in North American history. The majority of the burned area was in Alberta; only 90,000 ha were in BC.	0					10/4/1950 12:00:00 AM									0.0

On May 25th, the two fires that contributed to the Mississagi Fire were initiated; one in the Mississagi River Valley and the other in the Chapleau area. By mid-June, the fire(s) had burned 202,342 ha (2,023 km2) and smoke was carried as far as Washington DC, and in some reports, as far as Texas. On June 7th, the two fires combined into one. There were extraordinary efforts to contain the fire, including cloud-seeding. The fire was finally under control on July 21st, and out on August 1st. The fire had burned 302,510 ha (3,025 km2) and affected 54 townships. There was only 1 fatality (a firefighter). While this was one of the largest fires in Ontario's history, the Department of Forests and Lands undertook a salvage operation of fire-damaged timber and saved 300,000,000 foot board measure (fbm) of timber.	1					8/1/1948 12:00:00 AM									0.0

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Wildfire	Lac La Biche, Alberta	5/19/1919 12:00:00 AM	On May 19th, a wildfire had just been spotted when it reached and burned the small community of Lac La Biche, AB. It was an ideal fire season for the area; the winter of 1919 had a low snowfall, followed by an early spring drought, and hot and dry conditions in May. Within hours, the entire community had burned  down, except for the local inn, church, train station and a few other buildings. Property damage and inventory losses were estimated to be over $200,000 (1919 CAD). This fire, however, was part of a larger complex that stretched to Prince Albert, SK, and Meadow Lake, SK (over 300 km east). In total, the fire burned over 2 million ha (20,000 km2) of forest. Indigenous lands and people were also deeply affected by this fire. For example, the fire reached a small Cree hunting party on Sekip Lake, SK, resulting in the death of 11 individuals, and the injury of 12 others.	11	12				5/28/1919 12:00:00 AM									0.0

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Winter Storm	Victoria, British Columbia	2/1/1916 12:00:00 AM	On February 1st, snow began to fall at 5:00am (local) and continued for 38 hours. On the first day of the storm, 25 cm fell, and on the second, a further 53 cm—78.3 cm of snow had fallen by the end of the storm. Since cars and streetcars were buried by the snow, Victoria reverted back to horses: the fire and police departments used horse-drawn sleighs, merchants converted their wagons to sleighs to make deliveries, milkmen strapped cans of milk to horses, and a local blacksmith created a steel snowplough to be pulled by horses. The winter to date had been cold, and the coal supply was already low leaving many families to burn trees in their yards and wooden fences; several families stayed in hotels. Roughly 800-1,000 soldiers training at a nearby base helped shovel snow, in addition to 150 hired labourers. Fifty men even pulled a wooden snowplough to help clear the streets. It took 2 weeks for Victoria to return to normal routines. This event is sometimes called the "Great Snow" as an estimated 8 million tonnes had fallen.						2/2/1916 12:00:00 AM									0.0

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Wildfire	Fernie, British Columbia	7/1/1908 12:00:00 AM	In July of 1908, a wildfire was intentionally left in the Elk River Valley because it was burning non-merchantable lumber. After 4 weeks, the fire approached the community of Fernie - where after burning through slash piles - the wind picked up and pushed the fire into the community. On August 1st, the fire destroyed all by 16 homes in Fernie in less than 90 minutes. Many residents were evacuated by train. The fire burned 25,900 ha (25.9 km2). There are conflicting reports on the overall losses, however, there were up to 22 deaths, $2 million to $5 million (1908 CAD) in losses, 1,000 burned structures, and 6,000 homeless individuals.	22					9/30/1908 12:00:00 AM									0.0	
Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Flood	Old Man River, Alberta	6/6/1908 12:00:00 AM	In June of 1908, Old Man River in Alberta experienced one of its highest peak flows in history; caused by heavy rains and an already saturated ground because of snowmelt. On June 6th, the peak flow was estimated to be 200,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) , and 8 m (26.7 ft.) above normal river levels. Due to the floods of 1902, the river had widened, therefore the flood of 1908 had a higher volume of water but a slightly less height above normal. Regardless, the 1908 flood caused significant losses to several communities such as Lethbridge and McLeod, AB. This included a population dip in Lethbridge, significant damage to critical infrastructure  (e.g. damage to the new CPR bridge, viaduct, powerhouse, and hospital), and the destruction of many homes.						6/6/1908 12:00:00 AM									0.0
