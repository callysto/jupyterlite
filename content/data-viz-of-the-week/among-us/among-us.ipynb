    "Callysto's Weekly Data Visualization is a learning resource that aims to develop data literacy skills. We provide Grades 5-12 teachers and students with a data visualization, like a graph, to interpret. This companion resource walks learners through how the data visualization is created and interpreted by a data scientist. \n",

    "3. Organize - Arrange the data, so that you can easily explore it. \n",
    "4. Explore - Examine the data to look for evidence to answer the question. This includes creating visualizations. \n",
    "5. Interpret - Describe what's happening in the data visualization. \n",

Steam allows a lot of their game data to be accessed programmatically using what's called an Application Programming Interface or API. The API is how many of the websites hosting information about steam trends get their data. We will avoid the complexities of interacting with an API and just use the curated information at steamcharts.  The data was gathered in February 2021. "
