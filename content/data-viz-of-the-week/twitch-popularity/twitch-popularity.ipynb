    "Callysto's Weekly Data Visualization is a learning resource that aims to develop data literacy skills.

This companion resource walks learners through how the data visualization is created and interpreted by a data scientist. \n",

    "\n",
    "There are many sources for information about Twitch and its usage statistics. We used a site called Twitch Analytics hosted by SullyGnome.com The website is here: https://sullygnome.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "This web page has several options for downloading information. They asked us not to \"scrape\" data from the site, so we had a choice of downloading their files in csv format (Comma Separated Values), or copying and pasting directly from the web page into our own spreadsheets and saving as csv. Here are our four files for this project: \n",
    "- watch-time-30.csv  The list amount of time (hours) watched, per game, in the last 30 days\n",
    "- watch-time-365.csv Ditto, but in the last 365 days\n",
    "- peak-viewers-30.csv The list of peak number of viewers, per game, in the last 30 days\n",
    "- peak-viewers-365.csv Ditto, but in the last 365 days\n",
    "\n",
    "We did discover that copying and pasting gave us better data. We suspect the CSV files directly downloaded from the website are flawed. (We sent a message to the author of the sullygnom.com webpage.) Our data was downloaded on February 28, 2021. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then upload the .csv file on our Jupyter hub, where we can access it with our code. These files are all available when you access this code on the Callysto hub."
